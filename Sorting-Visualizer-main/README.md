## About

The Sorting Visualizer project is aimed at providing a clear and visual representation of different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. The project is implemented using web technologies, allowing you to run it in a web browser and interact with the sorting process.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sorting-visualizer`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the Sorting Visualizer open in your web browser, you can do the following:

- Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the speed of the visualization to your preference.
- Generate a new random array of elements to be sorted.
- Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.

The visualization will display the sorting process step by step, highlighting the elements being compared and swapped to give you a better understanding of how the chosen sorting algorithm works.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This project currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Feel free to contribute and add more sorting algorithms to the project!
